## Social Media Content Analyzer

### Project Overview
Social Media Content Analyzer is an application that allows users to upload PDF and image files, extract text, and suggest ways to improve engagement on social media posts.

### Approach
The project supports uploading both PDF and image files using a drag-and-drop or file picker interface. PDFs are parsed to extract formatted text using `pdf.js`. Image files are processed using `Tesseract.js` for OCR to extract text. This content is analyzed, and suggestions are made for improving engagement on social media posts.

### Features
- Drag-and-drop file upload (PDF and images)
- PDF text extraction with formatting
- OCR for image text extraction
